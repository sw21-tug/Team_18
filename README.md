# Team_18 - $aveUp


$aveUp is a personal finance application that helps you manage your money more effectively by keeping track of your income and expenses. You can easily record your expenses and income, view them monthly under specific categories, and easily manage your budget. 



## Vision

Managing our budget is crucial anytime but especially right now, with the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. The financial implications of the COVID-19 have affected our bill payments, mortgages, car payments. 
For many people, the idea of logging every transaction into a personal budget sounds like the world's tedious, insignificant task. But truthfully, there are several critical benefits. We should track our expenses to identify and eliminate wasteful spending habits in our financial life. Tracking our costs will help us maintain control of our finances and promote better financial practices like saving & investing.
